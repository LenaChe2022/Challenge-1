bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description

This is my first Challenge at bootcamp. As a bootcamp student I refactored existing code (improved it without changing what it does) to make it more accessible. Web accessibility ensured that people with disabilioties can access a wabpage using assistive technologies.
Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.
I made all links to function correctly, added semantic HTML elements and improoved the structure of the code; increased the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page. 
During this challenge I learned "Do Not Repeat Yourself" code principle, reading and understand existing code.
